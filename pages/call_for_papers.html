<h2>12th International Workshop on Software Clones (IWSC 2018)</h2>
<h3>Co-located with the 25th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2018)</h3>
<h3>March 19, 2018, Campobasso, Italy</h3>

<p>Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of ad-hoc reuse by programmers,
  and can occur at many levels, from simple statement sequences to blocks, methods, classes, source files,
  subsystems, models, architectures and entire designs, and in all software artifacts (code, models,
  requirements or architecture documentation, etc.). Software clone research is of high relevance for
  software engineering research and practice today.</p>

<p>
IWSC series of events has provided a common forum for this important research area as it continues
to grow in application breadth and technical depth. IWSC aims to bring researchers and practitioners to evaluate the current state of research, discuss common problems and emerging directions. In particular, we expect the in-depth analysis of use cases and experiences of clone management in practice to further shape our research.
Further details about IWSC 2018 are here on this website (<a href="https://iwsc2018.github.io/">https://iwsc2018.github.io/</a>).
